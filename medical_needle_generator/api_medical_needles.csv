"**SUBJECTIVE:**

Patient is a 28-year-old female graduate student presenting for evaluation of ""debilitating sleepiness."" Symptoms began approximately 1.5 years ago and have progressively worsened. She reports an overwhelming urge to sleep during the day, particularly in monotonous situations like lectures or while reading. She describes these episodes as ""sleep attacks"" that come on suddenly and are irresistible, lasting 10-20 minutes, after which she feels briefly refreshed. She also reports two peculiar episodes in the last six months where she felt sudden, brief muscle weakness in her knees and dropped to the floor while laughing uproariously with friends; she remained fully conscious throughout. She denies any loss of consciousness, aura, or post-ictal confusion. She notes her nighttime sleep is fragmented with frequent awakenings and vivid, often frightening dreams that feel ""extremely real."" She occasionally experiences a sensation of being unable to move for a minute or two upon waking in the morning. She drinks 4-5 cups of coffee daily with minimal effect. Denies snoring, witnessed apneas, or restless legs. No significant past medical history. Medications: None. Allergies: NKDA. Social history: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol. Family history is non-contributory.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vital Signs: BP 118/76, HR 68, RR 14, Temp 36.8°C, SpO2 99% on room air.
General: Pleasant, well-nourished female, appears fatigued, yawning intermittently during the interview.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Oropharynx clear, Mallampati class II.
Neck: Supple, no thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout, no focal weakness. Sensory: Intact to light touch. Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric. Gait: Normal. Romberg negative.
Psychiatric: Alert and oriented x4. Mood anxious, affect congruent.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1. **Excessive Daytime Sleepiness with Cataplexy-like Episodes:** The patient's history is significant for severe, persistent daytime sleepiness with sudden sleep attacks, fragmented nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid dreams), and sleep paralysis. The episodes of transient, emotion-triggered muscle weakness without loss of consciousness are highly suggestive of cataplexy. This constellation of symptoms points toward a central disorder of hypersomnolence.
2. **Rule out Other Sleep Disorders:** While symptoms are not classic for obstructive sleep apnea, this must be formally evaluated.
3. **Anxiety:** Related to symptom burden and impact on daily functioning.

**PLAN:**

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Normal bowel sounds.
Extremities: Skin is cool and dry to touch. No pretibial edema. Delayed relaxation phase of the Achilles deep tendon reflexes noted.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1.  **Hypothyroidism, likely autoimmune in etiology.** The constellation of symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation), physical exam findings (bradycardia, cool/dry skin, delayed DTRs, firm/goitrous thyroid), and strong family history are highly suggestive. The goiter with a firm, irregular texture is a key finding pointing toward a chronic inflammatory process.
2.  **Unexplained weight gain.**

**PLAN:**

1.  **Diagnostics:**
    *   Order thyroid function tests: TSH, Free T4.
    *   Order thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) and thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Ab) to evaluate for autoimmune thyroiditis.
    *   Consider a thyroid ultrasound to further characterize gland morphology given the palpable irregularity.
2.  **Treatment:**
    *   Hold initiation of thyroid hormone replacement until lab results return to confirm diagnosis and establish a baseline.
3.  **Patient Education:**
    *   Discussed the likely diagnosis of an underactive thyroid gland, explaining the autoimmune process as a probable cause.

Patient is a 35-year-old male presenting for follow-up regarding persistent axial pain. He reports a 9-month history of progressive low back pain and stiffness, which he initially attributed to a gym injury. The pain is localized to the sacral and gluteal regions bilaterally. He describes the stiffness as most severe upon waking, lasting approximately 90 minutes and improving with a hot shower and light movement. The pain does not improve with rest; in fact, he states it is worse after sitting for prolonged periods at his desk job. He denies any recent trauma, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. He notes occasional pain in his right heel, particularly when first stepping out of bed in the morning. He reports a history of recurrent episodes of painful redness in his right eye about 4 months ago, diagnosed as ""iritis"" by an optometrist and treated with steroid drops. He takes over-the-counter NSAIDs with partial relief. Family history is notable for his father having severe ""back problems"" requiring surgery in his 40s, though details are unclear. Review of systems is positive for notable fatigue and intermittent discomfort in his right shoulder. Denies current gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, or urinary complaints.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: BP 128/78, HR 72, Temp 98.6°F, SpO2 99% RA.
General: Well-appearing male, in no acute distress. Moves somewhat stiffly when transitioning from sitting to standing.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI. Sclera clear. No oral ulcers.
Musculoskeletal: Posture shows subtle flattening of the normal lumbar lordosis. Tenderness to deep palpation over bilateral sacroiliac joints. Spinal range of motion is limited in all planes: forward flexion (fingertips to mid-shin), extension, and lateral rotation. Modified Schober test measures 3 cm of lumbar expansion (normal >5 cm). Chest expansion measured at the 4th intercostal space is 2.5 cm. Right shoulder demonstrates pain with abduction beyond 90 degrees. Right heel exhibits tenderness at the plantar fascia insertion (calcaneal enthesopathy). Neurologic exam: Strength 5/5 throughout lower extremities, sensation intact to light touch, reflexes 2+ and symmetric, negative straight leg raise bilaterally.

Patient is a 58-year-old male presenting for evaluation of a persistent, painful oral rash and new skin lesions. Symptoms began approximately 4 months ago with painful sores inside his mouth that made eating and drinking difficult. He describes the oral lesions as starting as ""blisters that pop easily,"" leaving raw, painful ulcers. Over the past 6 weeks, he has developed flaccid, fluid-filled blisters on his upper chest and back, which rupture with minimal friction, leaving tender, denuded areas that crust over. He reports significant fatigue and an unintentional 10-pound weight loss over this period due to pain with oral intake. He denies fever, chills, or new medication use. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed with lisinopril. He has no known drug allergies.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 88, Temp 98.7°F, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air.
General: Appears fatigued, in mild distress due to pain.
HEENT: Multiple shallow, irregularly shaped erosions with peripheral erythema noted on buccal mucosa, gingiva, and soft palate. Several intact, clear, flaccid vesicles (~0.5-1 cm) are visible on the posterior hard palate. Positive Nikolsky sign elicited on perilesional buccal mucosa (lateral pressure induces extension of erosion).
Skin: Scattered on upper chest and interscapular back: multiple erosions with peripheral collarettes of scale and crust. Several intact, flaccid bullae containing clear fluid are present. Gentle lateral pressure on normal-appearing skin adjacent to a blister (Nikolsky sign) produces epidermal separation. No lesions on palms, soles, or scalp noted.
Lymph: No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1.  **Severe, chronic mucocutaneous blistering disorder.** The presentation is characterized by painful, persistent oral erosions preceding cutaneous flaccid bullae and erosions. The positive Nikolsky sign on both oral mucosa and perilesional skin is a significant physical exam finding. The chronicity (4 months), mucosal predominance, and morphology of the lesions are highly suggestive of an autoimmune intraepidermal blistering process.
2.  **Unintentional weight loss.** Likely secondary to odynophagia and decreased oral intake.
3.  **Hypertension,** stable.

"**SUBJECTIVE:**

Patient is a 28-year-old female graduate student presenting with a 3-month history of progressive, fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. She reports that her symptoms are most pronounced in the late afternoon and evening. She describes her eyelids feeling ""heavy"" and ""droopy,"" particularly when reading or looking at screens for extended periods. She notes intermittent double vision, especially when looking to the side for more than a few seconds. Over the past month, she has experienced increasing difficulty chewing, stating she becomes fatigued halfway through a meal and has to rest her jaw. Her speech occasionally becomes ""nasal"" and slurred after prolonged conversation. She denies any sensory changes, pain, fever, or recent illness. She has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. Family history is non-contributory.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: BP 118/76, HR 72, RR 14, Temp 98.6°F, SpO2 99% on room air.
General: Alert, oriented, but appears fatigued. Speech is clear at rest.
HEENT: Mild bilateral ptosis noted, more pronounced on the right. Ptosis worsens significantly after 60 seconds of sustained upward gaze. Extraocular movements are full but reveal intermittent horizontal diplopia on lateral gaze, which fatigues with sustained effort. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Facial muscle strength is symmetric but weak; she is unable to maintain a tight lip seal against resistance for more than 10 seconds.
Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact aside from findings above. Motor: 5/5 strength in all major muscle groups proximally and distally at rest. However, after 30 seconds of sustained shoulder abduction, strength deteriorates to 4/5. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric throughout. Sensation is intact to light touch. Gait is steady. No dysmetria.
Cardiopulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Regular rate and rhythm.
**Ice Pack Test (Performed at Bedside):** Application of an ice pack over the right eye for 2 minutes resulted in a noticeable, subjective and objective improvement in the ptosis.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1.  **Fatigable Muscle Weakness with Bulbar and Ocular Involvement:** The patient presents with a classic pattern of progressive, fatigueable weakness affecting the ocular, facial, and bulbar muscles. The diurnal variation (worse with repetition and later in the day) and the positive response to the ice pack test are highly characteristic of a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The absence of sensory findings or upper motor neuron signs localizes the issue to the neuromuscular junction or muscle itself.

**PLAN:**

1.  **Diagnostic Workup:**

Patient is a 62-year-old male who presents for evaluation of a ""painful mouth and skin that's falling off."" Symptoms began approximately 3 months ago with the development of painful sores inside his mouth, making eating and drinking difficult. He reports a 15-pound unintentional weight loss over this period due to decreased oral intake. Two months ago, he began developing flaccid, fluid-filled blisters on his upper chest and back that easily rupture, leaving raw, weeping erosions. He describes a positive Nikolsky sign, noting that ""rubbing the skin near a blister makes it spread."" The lesions are extremely painful and pruritic. He denies fever, chills, or new medication use. He reports increasing fatigue but attributes it to poor nutrition and pain. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications: Lisinopril 10mg daily, Atorvastatin 20mg daily. No known drug allergies.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: T 98.7°F, BP 142/88, HR 88, RR 14, SpO2 98% on room air.
General: Patient appears uncomfortable and fatigued. Mucous membranes are moist but with significant lesions.
HEENT: Oral mucosa reveals multiple shallow, irregularly shaped erosions on the buccal mucosa, soft palate, and gingiva. Several intact, thin-roofed vesicles are noted on the posterior hard palate. Conjunctivae are clear.
Skin: Examination of the chest, upper back, and axillae reveals scattered, flaccid bullae measuring 0.5-3 cm on normal-appearing and erythematous skin. Numerous denuded, weeping erosions with peripheral collarettes of scale are present. Gentle lateral pressure on perilesional skin (Nikolsky sign) produces extension of an erosion. No lesions on palms or soles.
Lymph: No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1. **Severe mucocutaneous blistering disorder** with predominant mucosal involvement. The clinical presentation of painful oral erosions preceding widespread, flaccid bullae and erosions with a positive Nikolsky sign is highly suggestive of an autoimmune blistering process targeting epithelial adhesion.
2. **Significant weight loss and nutritional risk** secondary to painful oral lesions.
3. **Hypertension**, stable.
4. **Hyperlipidemia**, stable.

**PLAN:**

Patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for evaluation of a ""painful mouth and skin that blisters easily."" Symptoms began approximately 4 months ago with intermittent oral sores that he attributed to canker sores. Over the last 6 weeks, he has developed flaccid, fluid-filled blisters on his chest, back, and in his groin that rupture easily, leaving painful, non-healing erosions. He reports significant pain with eating and drinking, leading to a 12-pound unintentional weight loss over two months. He describes a positive Nikolsky sign, noting that rubbing normal-appearing skin near a blister causes new erosion. He denies fever, chills, or new medication use. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension. No known drug allergies. He reports increased fatigue but attributes it to poor oral intake.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 88, Temp 98.7°F, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air.
General: Appears uncomfortable, with guarded movements to avoid friction on skin.
HEENT: Multiple shallow, irregular erosions on buccal mucosa, gingiva, and hard palate. No active intact oral blisters visualized. Oropharynx clear.
Skin: Exam reveals multiple scattered, flaccid bullae, 0.5-2 cm in diameter, on the upper chest and mid-back. Several have ruptured, leaving moist, erythematous erosions with peripheral crusting and minimal surrounding inflammation. A positive Nikolsky sign is elicited on the upper back. No lesions on palms or soles. Scalp shows two small, crusted erosions.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1. **Severe painful oral and cutaneous erosive disorder.** The presentation of chronic, painful mucosal involvement followed by widespread flaccid bullae and erosions, coupled with a positive Nikolsky sign, is highly suggestive of an autoimmune blistering process. The primary differential includes disorders of acantholysis.
2. **Unintentional weight loss,** secondary to odynophagia and decreased oral intake.
3. **Essential hypertension,** stable.

**PLAN:**

1. **Diagnostics:**
   * Biopsy for H&E and direct immunofluorescence: One 4-mm punch biopsy from the edge of a fresh blister on the back for routine histology. A second 4-mm punch biopsy of perilesional skin (within 1 cm of a blister) for direct immunofluorescence, placed in Michel's transport medium.

Patient is a 58-year-old male who presents for evaluation of a ""painful mouth and skin that blisters easily."" Symptoms began approximately 4 months ago with intermittent painful sores in his oral cavity, which he attributed to ill-fitting dentures. Over the past 6-8 weeks, he has developed recurrent, flaccid blisters on his upper chest, back, and scalp that rupture easily, leaving painful, non-healing erosions. He reports new lesions appear with minimal friction or pressure. He describes significant odynophagia, leading to decreased oral intake and an associated 12-pound weight loss over two months. He denies fever, chills, or new medications. He reports fatigue but attributes it to poor sleep due to pain. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes lisinopril and atorvastatin. No known drug allergies.

**ASSESSMENT:**

62-year-old male with acute to subacute onset of progressive, ascending, symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy with areflexia. The temporal association with a preceding gastrointestinal illness is notable. The primary differential includes an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Other considerations such as toxic/metabolic neuropathy (e.g., B12 deficiency, diabetes), spinal cord compression, or other neuromuscular disorders must be ruled out. The pattern of ascending weakness with loss of reflexes following a viral prodrome is highly characteristic of an acquired inflammatory process affecting peripheral nerves.

Patient is a 28-year-old female graduate student who presents for evaluation of ""uncontrollable sleepiness."" She reports a 9-month history of profound daytime sleepiness that occurs daily, regardless of the amount of nighttime sleep (typically 7-8 hours). She describes it as an overwhelming, irresistible urge to sleep, often occurring during sedentary activities like lectures or reading. She has fallen asleep twice during laboratory meetings in the last month. She also reports two episodes in the last six months where she experienced sudden, brief bilateral knee buckling and collapsed to the floor when she heard a particularly funny joke, regaining muscle control immediately. She denies loss of consciousness during these episodes. She notes occasional vivid, dream-like hallucinations just as she is falling asleep at night, which she describes as ""seeing spiders on the wall."" She sometimes experiences a sensation of being unable to move for a few seconds upon waking in the morning. She denies snoring, witnessed apneas, or significant caffeine intake. She states the sleepiness is severely impacting her academic performance. No recent illness, head trauma, or new medications. Past medical history is unremarkable.

"**SUBJECTIVE:**

Patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with a 10-day history of progressive weakness and sensory changes. He reports it began with tingling and ""pins and needles"" in the soles of both feet, which ascended to his calves over 2-3 days. This was followed by the onset of leg weakness, making it difficult to climb stairs and rise from a seated position. He now describes a feeling of ""heaviness"" in his legs and mild unsteadiness when walking. He denies any recent febrile illness, but notes a mild, self-resolved episode of diarrhea approximately two weeks prior to symptom onset. He reports no back pain, bladder or bowel incontinence, or cognitive changes. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. He works as an accountant and is right-handed.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vitals: BP 138/86, HR 72, RR 14, Temp 98.7°F, SpO2 98% on room air.
General: Alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
Neurological Exam:
*   **Mental Status:** Intact.
*   **Cranial Nerves:** II-XII grossly intact. Facial sensation and strength are normal.
*   **Motor:** Strength is 5/5 in bilateral deltoids, biceps, and triceps. Strength in hip flexors is 4/5 bilaterally. Knee extension is 4-/5, and ankle dorsiflexion is 3/5 bilaterally. Plantar flexion is 4/5. Tone is globally diminished in the lower extremities.
*   **Sensory:** Reduced light touch and pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution up to the mid-calves. Vibration sense is diminished at the toes. Proprioception is intact.
*   **Reflexes:** **Areflexic in both patellar and Achilles tendons.** Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1+.
*   **Coordination:** Mild dysmetria on heel-to-shin testing bilaterally, likely secondary to weakness. Finger-to-nose is intact.
*   **Gait:** Wide-based, unsteady gait requiring occasional contact with the wall for support. Unable to perform heel or toe walking.

**ASSESSMENT:**

45-year-old male with acute to subacute onset of ascending, symmetric sensorimotor deficits, most pronounced in the lower extremities, with associated areflexia. The temporal progression, pattern of weakness, and neurological findings are highly concerning for an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy. The antecedent history of gastrointestinal symptoms is notable. Differential diagnosis includes other metabolic, toxic, or infectious neuropathies, though the clinical presentation is most consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy process.

**PLAN:**

1.  **Admission:** Admit to inpatient neurology service for close monitoring of respiratory function (FVC, NIF) and progression",guillain-barré syndrome,True,Guillain-Barré Syndrome (Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy - AIDP),95
"**SUBJECTIVE:**

Patient is a 51-year-old female presenting for evaluation of persistent fatigue and ""brain fog"" over the past 8-10 months. She describes a gradual onset of profound tiredness, not relieved by sleep, which impacts her ability to work as a librarian. She notes increased sensitivity to cold, frequently wearing sweaters when others are comfortable. She has gained approximately 12 pounds unintentionally over this period despite no significant change in diet or activity. She reports dry skin, brittle nails, and mild constipation. She denies palpitations, heat intolerance, or significant hair loss. She has a family history of ""thyroid problems"" in her maternal aunt. Current medications include a daily multivitamin. No known drug allergies.

**OBJECTIVE:**

Vital Signs: BP 118/72, HR 58, RR 14, Temp 97.8°F (oral), SpO2 99% on room air.
General: Pleasant, appears tired. Moves slowly.
HEENT: Face appears slightly full/periorbital puffiness. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Thyroid gland is palpable, diffusely enlarged (estimated 1.5 times normal size), firm, and non-tender with a slightly irregular contour. No bruit.
Cardiovascular: Regular bradycardic rate. No murmurs.
Skin: Cool, dry skin with mild xerosis. Delayed relaxation phase of the Achilles deep tendon reflex noted bilaterally.

**Laboratory Results (from today):**
* TSH: 8.2 mIU/L (Reference: 0.4 - 4.5)
* Free T4: 0.7 ng/dL (Reference: 0.8 - 1.8)
* Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies: 350 IU/mL (Reference: <9)
* Thyroglobulin Antibodies: 120 IU/mL (Reference: <4)
* CBC: Unremarkable. Mild normocytic anemia (Hgb 11.8 g/dL).
* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits.

**ASSESSMENT:**

1. **Primary Hypothyroidism:** Biochemical confirmation with elevated TSH and low Free T4. The presence of strongly positive thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies points to an autoimmune etiology as the underlying cause. The physical exam findings (bradycardia, delayed reflexes, cool/dry skin, goiter) are consistent with this diagnosis.
2. **Unintentional Weight Gain:** Likely secondary to reduced metabolic rate from hypothyroidism.
3. **Fatigue and Cognitive Changes (""Brain Fog""):** Attributed to hypothyroid state.
4. **Mild Anemia:** May be related to hypothyroidism or require further investigation if it does not correct with thyroid hormone replacement.

**PLAN:**

1. **Initiate Thyroid Hormone Replacement:** Start Levothyroxine 50 mcg orally once daily on an empty stomach, 30-",hashimoto's thyroiditis,True,Primary Hypothyroidism due to Autoimmune Thyroiditis (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis),99
